### 1. **Scatter Plots for Normalized Data:**

You are plotting scatter plots for normalized data based on different times (14d, 23d, 26d, and 29d) in the first set of plots. These seem mostly fine for showing trends over time but make sure the y-axis is indeed representing the velocity, as it is normalized by `uj`. 

Make sure your data for each plot is in the correct format, and check whether the corresponding `y` and `U` values are in the correct scale for each set of plots (you are already normalizing these by `d` and `uj`).

### 2. **Self Similarity Plot:**

The self-similar plot normalizes `y` with respect to a reference value `yRef`. You calculate the difference between the reference and your data and plot that difference with the corresponding velocity normalized by `u0`. 

The logic seems fine here, but be aware that you're shifting and normalizing `y` values, which might affect the visual interpretation. If the plots are still unclear or misleading, try comparing both raw and normalized data to see the effect more clearly.

### 3. **Velocity Profiles with Centerline Velocity and Half-Width:**

The velocity profile plot is attempting to show both normalized centerline velocity and normalized half-width. Since these are on different scales, you might want to use two different y-axes to avoid misleading results (left for centerline velocity, right for half-width), or separate the two into different plots for clarity.

### 4. **Flux Calculations (Mass, Momentum, Energy):**

You are calculating mass flux, momentum flux, and energy flux. This involves integrating the squared, cubic, or similar terms of the velocity profiles (`U^2`, `U^3`). The integrals seem to be using the following logic:

```python
massFlux.append( pow( Integrate( Ncolumn_6_data , 0.3 )/1.8, 2 ) )
```

Make sure that the data you're integrating is on the correct scale, and that the step size (`dx` = 0.3) corresponds to the data's spacing.

You can simplify this if the integration step is constant, or adjust the `dx` if the data has varying spacing.

### 5. **Plotting Fluxes:**

You plot mass flux, momentum flux, and energy flux after calculating them. The linear fit on these plots might be misleading if the data doesn't show a clear linear trend. If there are non-linear relationships, you may want to try fitting with higher-degree polynomials or other types of regression that better capture the pattern in your data.

### Possible Improvements and Corrections:

- **Y-Axis Labeling:**
  Ensure the y-axis is properly labeled for each plot (i.e., "Normalized y" for the first set, "Normalized U" for the second set, and so on). This will make the plots more interpretable.

- **Separate Y-Axis for Different Variables:**
  If you are showing two different variables (e.g., centerline velocity and half-width), consider using a secondary y-axis, or split them into two plots to avoid confusing scales.

- **Check the Range of Normalization:**
  Double-check that the normalization is consistent across all datasets, particularly `d` and `uj`, and that the scaling corresponds correctly to the physical meaning you want to convey.
